### Incremental Learning Steps for SQL Developer

**Scenario: Building the "Search for Restaurants" Functionality**

To implement this feature, the SQL developer needs to build their skills incrementally. Here are the steps, presented as challenges with hints, QCMs (Questionnaire Ã  Choix Multiples), and solutions.

#### **Step 1: Understanding Basic SQL Queries**

**Challenge 1:** Write a basic SQL query to select all restaurants from the database.
- **Hint:** Use the `SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `restaurants` table.

**QCM 1:**
- **Q:** What is the correct SQL statement to select all columns from the `restaurants` table?
  - a) `SELECT restaurants FROM *;`
  - b) `SELECT * FROM restaurants;`
  - c) `GET ALL FROM restaurants;`
- **Solution:** b) `SELECT * FROM restaurants;`

**Explanation:** The `SELECT * FROM restaurants;` statement retrieves all columns from the `restaurants` table.

#### **Step 2: Filtering Data with `WHERE` Clause**

**Challenge 2:** Write an SQL query to find all Italian restaurants.
- **Hint:** Use the `WHERE` clause to filter results based on the `cuisine` column.

**QCM 2:**
- **Q:** How would you modify the query to select only Italian restaurants?
  - a) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian';`
  - b) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE food = 'Italian';`
  - c) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WITH cuisine = 'Italian';`
- **Solution:** a) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian';`

**Explanation:** The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only rows where the `cuisine` column matches 'Italian'.

#### **Step 3: Using Multiple Filters**

**Challenge 3:** Write an SQL query to find all Italian restaurants in New York.
- **Hint:** Combine multiple conditions using the `AND` operator.

**QCM 3:**
- **Q:** How would you modify the query to select Italian restaurants located in New York?
  - a) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' AND city = 'New York';`
  - b) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' OR city = 'New York';`
  - c) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' AND location = 'New York';`
- **Solution:** a) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' AND city = 'New York';`

**Explanation:** Using `AND` combines both conditions, filtering for Italian restaurants specifically in New York.

#### **Step 4: Sorting Results**

**Challenge 4:** Write an SQL query to find all Italian restaurants in New York, sorted by rating.
- **Hint:** Use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results.

**QCM 4:**
- **Q:** How would you modify the query to sort the results by rating in descending order?
  - a) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' AND city = 'New York' ORDER BY rating DESC;`
  - b) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' AND city = 'New York' SORT BY rating DESC;`
  - c) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' AND city = 'New York' ORDER rating DESC;`
- **Solution:** a) `SELECT * FROM restaurants WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' AND city = 'New York' ORDER BY rating DESC;`

**Explanation:** The `ORDER BY rating DESC` clause sorts the results by the `rating` column in descending order.

#### **Step 5: Implementing the Query in Code**

**Challenge 5:** Integrate the SQL query into the application code to enable the search functionality.
- **Hint:** Use a parameterized query in your programming language to prevent SQL injection.

**QCM 5:**
- **Q:** What is the best practice for integrating SQL queries in application code?
  - a) Hard-code the query string directly in the code.
  - b) Use parameterized queries to handle user inputs safely.
  - c) Allow users to input raw SQL queries for flexibility.
- **Solution:** b) Use parameterized queries to handle user inputs safely.

**Explanation:** Parameterized queries protect against SQL injection by separating SQL logic from user inputs.

By following these incremental steps, the SQL developer builds a strong foundation in writing and integrating SQL queries, ultimately enabling them to implement the "Search for Restaurants" feature effectively.
