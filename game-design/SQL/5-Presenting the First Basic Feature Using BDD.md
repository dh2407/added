### Presenting the First Basic Feature Using BDD

**Scene: A small conference room at Restaurant Guru's office. The new developer, Alex, is seated at the table. Sara and Bahi, the team leaders, are standing at the front, ready to present the first feature using BDD (Behavior-Driven Development).**

**Sara**: Hi Alex, now that you have a good understanding of our vision, let’s dive into our first basic feature using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). We’ll keep this brief and straightforward.

**Bahi**: Our first feature is the "Search for Restaurants" functionality. This allows users to find restaurants based on specific criteria like cuisine, location, and rating. Here’s how we define it using BDD.

**Feature: Search for Restaurants**
- **Scenario:** User searches for a restaurant by cuisine and location.
  - **Given** a user is on the Restaurant Guru homepage,
  - **When** they enter "Italian" in the cuisine search field,
  - **And** they enter "New York" in the location search field,
  - **And** they click the "Search" button,
  - **Then** they should see a list of Italian restaurants in New York.

**Sara**: This scenario ensures that our search functionality works as expected. It’s a clear and simple way to define the behavior we want to achieve.

**Bahi**: Implementing features with BDD helps us maintain clarity and focus on delivering the best user experience. We’ll start with this basic functionality and expand from there.

**Sara**: Any questions about this feature or how we use BDD?

**Alex**: (Responds with questions or thoughts)

**Sara**: Great! Let’s get started on building this feature. Welcome to the team, Alex!
